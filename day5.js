//  Timeout Cancellation
/* Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and a timeout t in milliseconds, return a cancel function cancelFn.

After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)
Initially, the execution of the function fn should be delayed by t milliseconds.

If, before the delay of t milliseconds, the function cancelFn is invoked, it should cancel the delayed execution of fn. Otherwise, if cancelFn is not invoked within the specified delay t, fn should be executed with the provided args as arguments.

 

Example 1:

Input: fn = (x) => x * 5, args = [2], t = 20
Output: [{"time": 20, "returned": 10}]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 50;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x * 5, [2], 20);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelTimeMs (50ms), which happened after the execution of fn(2) at 20ms.
Example 2:

Input: fn = (x) => x**2, args = [2], t = 100
Output: []
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 50;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x**2, [2], 100);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelTimeMs (50ms), which happened before the execution of fn(2) at 100ms, resulting in fn(2) never being called.
Example 3:

Input: fn = (x1, x2) => x1 * x2, args = [2,4], t = 30
Output: [{"time": 30, "returned": 8}]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 100;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x1, x2) => x1 * x2, [2,4], 30);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelTimeMs (100ms), which happened after the execution of fn(2,4) at 30ms. */

function cancellable(fn, args, t) {
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), t);
    
    const cancelFn = () => {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    };
  
    return cancelFn;
  }
  
  const log = (...args) => console.log("Executed with:", ...args);
  
  const cancelTimeMs = 200;
  const delayTimeMs = 500; 
  
  const cancelFn = cancellable(log, [42, "hello"], delayTimeMs);
  
  setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

  
//   Interval Cancellation

/* Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t, return a cancel function cancelFn.

After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)
The function fn should be called with args immediately and then called again every t milliseconds until cancelFn is called at cancelTimeMs ms.

 

Example 1:

Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = [4], t = 35
Output: 
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 35, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 70, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 105, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 140, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 175, "returned": 8}
]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 190;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x * 2, [4], 35);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

Every 35ms, fn(4) is called. Until t=190ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms. fn(4) returns 8.
2nd fn call is at 35ms. fn(4) returns 8.
3rd fn call is at 70ms. fn(4) returns 8.
4th fn call is at 105ms. fn(4) returns 8.
5th fn call is at 140ms. fn(4) returns 8.
6th fn call is at 175ms. fn(4) returns 8.
Cancelled at 190ms
Example 2:

Input: fn = (x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), args = [2, 5], t = 30
Output: 
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 30, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 60, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 90, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 120, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 150, "returned": 10}
]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 165; 
const cancelFn = cancellable((x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), [2, 5], 30) 
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

Every 30ms, fn(2, 5) is called. Until t=165ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms 
2nd fn call is at 30ms 
3rd fn call is at 60ms 
4th fn call is at 90ms 
5th fn call is at 120ms 
6th fn call is at 150ms
Cancelled at 165ms
Example 3:

Input: fn = (x1, x2, x3) => (x1 + x2 + x3), args = [5, 1, 3], t = 50
Output: 
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 9},
   {"time": 50, "returned": 9},
   {"time": 100, "returned": 9},
   {"time": 150, "returned": 9}
]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 180;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x1, x2, x3) => (x1 + x2 + x3), [5, 1, 3], 50)
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

Every 50ms, fn(5, 1, 3) is called. Until t=180ms, then it is cancelled. 
1st fn call is at 0ms
2nd fn call is at 50ms
3rd fn call is at 100ms
4th fn call is at 150ms
Cancelled at 180ms */
